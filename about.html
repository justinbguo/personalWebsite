                                When I was younger, the entrepreneurship bug bit me, and that rash never went away. 
                                I obsessively took notes watching Shark Tank, listened to business podcasts, and tried to find little side hustles here and there. 
                                As I grew up, I developed an intuition for using technology and began to recognize its positive value to users.  
                                <br><br>
                                Now that I'm older, I've realized a high interest in another area within the tech space: product management.
                                PM to me is like a different, standardized variation of entrepreneurship that offers a similar 
                                thrill of building products and working with awesome people with lower levels of stress and risk. 
                                <br><br>
                                I love the idea of building features that anybody could understand and benefit from. I find the challenge 
                                of simplifying a deeply rooted painpoint into a layman's solution to be highly exciting. 
                                With the right implementation, users can derive a high amount of positive impact from even the smallest of product improvements.

                                                        <h3>üß† Creativity</h3>I try to approach situations from unorthodox angles, trying to find 
                                                        missing pieces that aren't immediately obvious. My capacity for imagination allows me to constantly think of a high number of out-of-the-box ideas.

                                                        <h3>üßê Critical Thinking:</h3>My rationality helps to balance my more imaginative side and eliminate ideas that are a bit too creative. 
                                                        I often try to apply my knowledge of cognitive biases to recognize when myself or others are using 
                                                        faulty heuristics to make illogical decisions.

                                                        <h3>üë§ Autonomy:</h3>I work on my own very effectively. 
                                                        I enjoy taking initiative and being given creative freedom with my work. 
                                                        This leads me to pursue a variety of side projects where I have to manage a large amount of ambiguity.

                                                        <h3>üòÑ Personability:</h3>I'd like to believe that I work with others well! I try to be an empathetic and supportive teammate
                                                        who doesn't complain, communicates well, and completes his tasks thoroughly and on time.

                                                        <h3>üîç Curiosity:</h3>I love to learn about interesting things. My curiosity works very closely 
                                                        with my creativity because of cross-functional knowledge. I read articles every day,
                                                        and I often find overlap between two seemingly unrelated fields, like biology and business, or 
                                                        obvious ones, like psychology and design.
